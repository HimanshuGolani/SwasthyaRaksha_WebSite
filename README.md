## Project Description

In today's fast-paced world, efficient and secure management of health data is a significant challenge for both patients and healthcare providers. Traditional methods of storing medical records on paper or disparate digital systems lead to issues such as data fragmentation, lack of real-time access, and potential data loss. Patients often face difficulties in keeping track of their medical history, sharing essential health information with multiple doctors, and remembering upcoming appointments. Similarly, doctors struggle with accessing comprehensive patient histories during emergencies and managing patient data seamlessly.

**SwasthyaRaksha** addresses these critical challenges by providing an integrated Health Data Management Platform that ensures efficient, secure, and user-friendly management of health records for both patients and healthcare providers.
